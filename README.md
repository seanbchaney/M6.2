# M6.2 Lab

In this project, I created a letterhead template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design involved fixing background images to the top and bottom of the letter, with a semi-transparent gradient for texture. I added a white background, a 1mm solid border, and included a logo with a cross-browser-compatible drop shadow. The body of the page was designed in a two-column format, and I implemented interactivity with a radio button and button, where clicking the button displays the selected radio buttonâ€™s text. The goal was to combine both creative design and basic web development skills.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
